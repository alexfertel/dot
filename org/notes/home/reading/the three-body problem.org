In 1967, physics professor Ye Zhetai is killed after he refuses to
denounce the theory of relativity. His daughter, Ye Wenjie, witnesses
his gruesome death.

"Shortly after, she's falsely charged with sedition for promoting the
works of environmentalist Rachel Carson, and told she can avoid

work becomes linked to a string of physicist suicides and a complex
role-playing game involving the classic physics problem of the title.
